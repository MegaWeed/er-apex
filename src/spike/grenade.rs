//! The frag grenade (U9): Season 3's `mp_weapon_frag_grenade` in Octane's hand, on G (Apex's PC
//! default `bind "g" "weaponSelectOrdnance"`, R5R cfg/config_default_pc.cfg). Endless (D-003, D-032;
//! the HUD shows ∞; our default, the user has not confirmed it). The report is
//! docs/m1/U9-grenade.md; the numbers are S3's, from R5R's `weapons/mp_weapon_frag_grenade.txt`
//! (retail's `apex-data/export/weapon/mp_weapon_frag_grenade.txt` has the same ones) and the S3
//! server `r5apex_ds.exe` where the settings leave a rule to native code.
//!
//! The hand (`Phase`, a weapon switch in S3): G puts the R-301 away (its `holster_time` 0.55 s,
//! _base_assault_rifle.txt) and draws the grenade (`deploy_time` 0.6 s; it can be thrown from
//! `draw_seq`'s AE_WPN_READYTOFIRE, frame 9 of 16). The trigger pulls the pin (`OnWeaponTossPrep`
//! plays `sound_deploy_1p` Weapon_FragGrenade_PinPull; the prep lasts `toss_pullout_time` 0.25 s,
//! 推断: which of ACT_VM_TOSS_PREP / _PREP_PULLOUT S3 plays from a drawn grenade is not traced), it
//! is held while the trigger is, and letting go throws it: underhand (`toss_time` 0.4 s, released at
//! `toss_seq`'s AE_WPN_TOSS_RELEASE, frame 7 of 17), or overhand when the eye looks up past
//! `offhandTossOverheadPitchThreshold` -1° (`toss_overhead_time` 0.7 s, frame 6 of 23; 0x1410095E0).
//! The fuse starts at the launch (`start_fuse_on_launch`, `grenade_fuse_time` 3.5 s; no cooking).
//! Then the R-301 comes back (its `deploy_time` 0.6 s, firing from AE_WPN_READYTOFIRE 12 of 25),
//! the grenade's own holster skipped after a throw (推断: the hand is empty). G again while it is
//! out does nothing (S3 `TryCycleOrdnance` with one kind of ordnance); 1/2, Q and Z put it away
//! before the throw (`OnWeaponTossCancel` = Grenade_OnWeaponTossCancelDrop: nothing is dropped);
//! after a throw the next one waits for `fire_rate` 0.83/s. The frames are retail's QC
//! (apex-data/assets/frag_grenade, tools/apexassets/frag_grenade_assets.py; S3's own view model is in
//! R5R's paks: 待对照).
//!
//! The throw (0x14100AA40, 0x141015A50, 0x141016140): from the eye, along the eye's angles with the
//! pitch raised by `projectile_launch_pitch_offset` 9° times clamp((pitch + 90) / 90, 0, 1) (full
//! level or below, none straight up), at `projectile_launch_speed` 1300 units/s, plus
//! `projectile_inherit_owner_velocity_scale` 1 times the player's horizontal speed along the view
//! (never backwards) along the view itself (the platform's base velocity is 0 here). Gravity: S3's
//! `sv_gravity` 750 times `projectile_gravity_scale` (1, the default).
//!
//! The flight: each frame a ray through the movement controller's triangles (kcc.rs, as the jump
//! pad's), else the game's own map ray when the grenade is outside that window (its normal from two
//! more rays). Bounces by `grenade_bounce_vel_frac_shallow` 0.6 / `_sharp` 0.4 /
//! `_along_normal` 0.3 / `_randomness` 0.05 / `_extra_vertical_randomness` 0.05 and rolling by
//! `grenade_roll_vel_frac_per_second` 0.05 (`grenade_can_roll` default 1): 推断, the native bounce
//! function was not found; see `bounce`. A grenade that bonks an enemy deals `damage_near_value` 10
//! (Grenade_Launch's touch damage, DF_EXPLOSION removed) once and bounces off it.
//!
//! The explosion (0x140B659A0, RadiusDamage 0x140CDCCB0): `explosion_damage` 100 in full within
//! `explosion_inner_radius` 125 units, falling linearly to 0 at `explosionradius` 350, measured to a
//! point three quarters of the way from the target's middle to its box's nearest point, and only
//! with a clear line (the map) to that point or to its eye. It hurts its thrower too
//! (`explosion_damages_owner`, native default 1; S3 _base_gametype.gnut ShouldEntTakeDamage: "no
//! suicide protection"). Enemies through the S6 damage bridge (`combat::shoot`).
